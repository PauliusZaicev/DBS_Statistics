Using Boston dataset I have applied linear regression modelling to predict the per capita crime rate using other variables in the data set. In other words, per capita crime rate is the response and the other variables are predictors.

*I used discreptive statistics to explore the dataset (by using Excel)
*For each predictor, fited a simple linear regression model to predict the response.(By using R)
*Fited a multiple regression model to predict the response using all the predictors and describer the results.(By using R)
*Compared simple and multiple linear regresion results. Plot was created to display the univariate regression coefficients from simple linear regression model on the x-axis, and the multiple regression coefficients from on the y-axis. Each predictor was displayed as a single point in the plot. (By using R)

Boston Data Set, Excel file, R sript and report are attached.
